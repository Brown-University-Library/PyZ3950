</title></head><body>
<p>I wrote these modules to support
<a href="http://www.pobox.com/~asl2/software/Tyrannio">Tyrannioware</a>,
my home book cataloging program.  The modules are distributed together
partly for my convenience, and partly because the Z39.50 code may serve
as an illustration of the ASN.1 API.  (I wrote my own ASN.1 code because
I wanted its client to be able to use normal Python data types, and use
a declarative syntax fairly close to the original ASN.1 specification
to encode and decode: neither <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pysnmp">
PySNMP</a> nor <a href="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/software/pisces/">Pisces
</a> offer this.)  The only other Python Z39.50 implementation I know of
is part of a larger commercial product, 
<a href="http://www.bsn.com/Z39.50/wxPresso.html">wxPresso</a>.
<p>There's also a MARC module in zmarc.py (handles parsing only), and
a graphical <a href="http://zthes.z3950.org">Zthes</a> browser as
an example.</p>
<p>The software requires Python 2.1 or later, and is licensed under
the X licence (details in the files themselves), but the zoom
interface requires Dave Beazley's <a
href="http://systems.cs.uchicago.edu/ply/">PLY package</a>, licensed
under the LGPL.  Click <a href="PyZ3950-0.97.tar.gz">here</a> to
download version 0.97 of PyZ3950.  It's packaged with distutils, so
unzip and untar, run <code>python setup.py build</code>, and then
<code>python setup.py install</code>.  Here's the <a
href="CHANGELOG">CHANGELOG</a>.  Most development has been done under
Linux, but I've tested briefly under Win98 (and, in theory, the code
should run anywhere Python runs).<p>


<H1>ZOOM</H1><p><a href="zoom.html">Link to pydoc documentation for zoom
        implementation (recommended interface).</a><H1>z3950</H1><p>PyZ3950 currently is capable of sending and receiving v2 PDUs
Initialize, Search, Present, Scan, Close, and Delete.  For client
work, you probably want to use ZOOM, which should be in the same
distribution as this file, in zoom.py.  The Server class in this file
implements a server, but could use some work.  Both interoperate with
the <a href="http://www.indexdata.dk/yaz"> Yaz toolkit</a> and the
client interoperates with a variety of libraries.  <p>

<H1>asn1</H1><p>asn1 is a relatively general-purpose ASN.1 BER encoder and decoder.
Encoding and
decoding functions  (asn1.encode and asn1.decode) take an ASN.1 spec, and
transform back and forth between a byte stream and what I consider a natural
Python representation of the data.  (Decoding applications where the length of
the BER is not provided externally and indefinite-length encodings are allowed
will have to instantiate their own decoding context: see the comments near
and source of decode.)
<p>Separating the ASN.1 specification from the code allows me to,
if it becomes desirable, compile the specification to inline Python or C
code, or to a specification for a C-based engine.
<p>I support the following ASN.1 types:
<ul>
<li>BOOLEAN - encoder takes any Python value, decoder produces 0 or 1</li>
<li>INTEGER - as in Python</li>
<li>BITSTRING - asn1.BitStringVal</li>
<li>OCTSTRING - Python string</li>
<li>NULL - ignore value on encoding, return None on decoding</li>
<li>OID - OidVal</li>
<li>EXTERNAL - as SEQUENCE, see below (or read the source)</li>
<li>all string types - Python string (no validity checking is done)</li>
</ul>
<p>For all the above types, the ASN.1 spec is just the name of the type.
Inherently constructed types:
<ul>
<li>SEQUENCE_OF (ASN1.spec) - Python representation is a list of values.</li>
<li>
SEQUENCE, CHOICE - the ASN.1 spec is a list of tuples, either (name, tag, type)
or, for SEQUENCE, (name, tag, type, optionalflag), where:
tag can be None, asn1.EXPLICIT(tag), asn1.IMPLICIT(tag), or an integer
interpreted as either an explicit or an implicit tag according to the setting
of asn1.implicit_default; type is recursively an ASN.1 spec.</li>
</ul>
<p>For CHOICE, the Python representation is (name, val).  For SEQUENCE, on
decoding,
the Python representation is an instance of an asn1-synthesized class.
On encoding, any class with the appropriate attributes is acceptable, but you
can obtain a fresh instance of the synthesized class by calling the SEQUENCE
specification: this class overrides setattr to provide attribute-name error
checking.  (The rationale for the seemingly unPythonic errorchecking is that
misspelled optional attributes would otherwise be hard to detect.  If you don't
like it, it should be easy to turn off.)
<p>
For examples, see the test code at the end of this file, or the
Z39.50 code that should be distributed with this file.
<p>
There is not yet support for:
<ul>
<li>Constructed encodings for BITSTRINGs</li>
<li>REAL, UTCTime, ENUM, SET, SET OF, or some more obscure types</li>
<li>APPLICATION or PRIVATE class tags</li>
<li>Symbolic names for enumerated values</li>
</ul>

Data</a>'s C Z39.50 implementation, Yaz, has been invaluable for doing 
interoperability testing on my local machine.
